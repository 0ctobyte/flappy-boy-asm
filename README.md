FlappyBoy
========= 

UPDATE: I've made this branch which is a port using the `Intelligent Systems` toolchain. This allows for debugging and testing using the IS-CGB-DEBUGGER tool.
For building this branch you'll need access to IS toolchain.

This is clone of Flappy Bird I made to learn about the Game Boy and how to build a really simple game for it.

The tools I used are:
- [RGBDS](https://bitbucket.org/JustinLloyd/rgbds-gameboy-development-system) to assemble my code < DEPRECATED >
- [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/) to test and debug < DEPRECATED >
- [EverDrive GB](http://krikzz.com/store/home/8-everdrive-gb.html) to run the game on device < DEPRECATED >

Here you can play the game on an online emulator.
